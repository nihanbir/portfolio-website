            "which is a positive integer. The task is to find the path from the bottom-right corner to top-left corner that passes " +
            "through the obstacles with the minimum total weight.\n" +
            "However, there is a catch - when the player pass through an obstacle, its weight is added to a running sum. If the running " +
            "sum becomes greater than a threshold value T, the player is teleported back to the bottom-right corner, and must start over.\n" +
            "To make the problem more interesting, the teleportation threshold T is not constant - it changes every time you get teleported. " +
            "Specifically, after being teleported, the new threshold value is set to be the sum of the weights of the obstacles the player passed " +
            "through on their previous attempt, multiplied by a constant C. At the start, T is always smaller than the sum of weights of the smallest " +
            "weight path to enforce at least one teleportation.\n" +
            
            "The goal: \n"+

            "account the random placement of the obstacles and the changing teleportation threshold. When the goal can't be reached with the " +
            "smallest weight path, the optimal thing for the player to do, would be to expand T maximally by taking the biggest weight path. " +
            "To solve the problem of finding the biggest weight path, a case which swaps the objective of the algorithm can be added.\n"+

            "BFS stores copies of all paths (when predecessor method isn't used), " +
